This React Native project was built from the standard template then had some standard packages added in that my application will use. There is no application code within this project other than what came in the template.

Yarn was used as the package manager to build.

I'm building initially for iPhone and within the PodFile I commented out the line user_flipper()

I've tested that this run in the simulator iPhone 12 14.4

If react-native-jssip is added in then it is possible to run the application but it breaks up the lauch of the app in the simulator.
